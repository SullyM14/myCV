                I am a motivated, generous and hard-working graduate looking for opportunities within the
                Computing industry. I can use a variety of coding languages and have a good understanding of
                businesses and how they work. I love to learn and am always willing to take on new challenges in all
                aspects of my life. This unique combination is what makes me believe that I would be an invaluable
                asset to any business, especially those in the computing sector.

            <p>
                One of my main interests is technology hence why I want to pursue a career in this field, so I always
                research new areas within the field and read up on the news for it every day. I also enjoy reading the
                news for other areas and like to keep up to date with the climate of the world. My biggest interest
                however is reading and writing. Since a young age I have enjoyed reading and as I grew older, I began
                to write and now almost every day I write a little and it helps me with my creativity. Furthermore,
                basketball is another huge hobby of mine which I spend time playing every day and has taught me a
                lot about teamwork and confidence in myself and hard work.
                My biggest achievement to date would be finishing second in the ITMB North Event in 2017 out of 30+
                universities. I was part of a group of 8 chosen by the university to enter a competition representing
                them where we would have to present in front of many companies, including IBM, Barclays and many
                others. The competition involved making a presentation about AI and how it can help solve a
                worldwide issue. Other achievements include having a poem published in the Young Writer’s poem
                book and successfully making the college basketball team.
